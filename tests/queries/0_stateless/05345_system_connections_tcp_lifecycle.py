# Lifecycle of one persistent native TCP connection in `system.connections`:
# 1. The connection is idle after a query.
# 2. The connection is active when a query runs.
# 3. The connection is idle after a query fails or after KILL QUERY.
# 4. The table does not show the connection after the client disconnects.
# The test uses the same `connection_id` for all steps. Other connections read the state of this connection.
# The server config must set `collect_connection_metrics` to `true`.
